            <h4>Early life</h4>
            <p>My early life was not the best. I always struggled with being a tubby kid and truly did not have fun with who I was</p>
            <div class="earlyLifeConatiner">
                <ul>
                    <li class="earlyLifeList">
                        I was bullied hard at school
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I love my parents, but I think my dad was way too hard on me as a kid, which made me very rebelious
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I was smart, but with all the hardship that was brought into my life, it was hard for me to stay focused during school
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I always wanted to seek out fun rather than work 
                    </li>
