# Full Time Web Development June 2021

This will be the repo for students of June 6, 2022 cohort.

# How to use this repo

You will have access to the examples I create during class as well as activities and assignments for the afternoon. During project weeks, you will see the requirements for the project listed here.
You should reference these projects to help with your understanding of the concepts we go over in class.

Do not just copy and paste these projects and assume you know how they will work. Create them from scratch, delete them and do it again. Practice will make this more familiar and will be the only way you start understanding concepts better.

# Folder Structure
