# List and stuff

array = ["ğŸ¦®"]
array[0] = ğŸ’©
list = []
Access things inside of list using an index

print(array[0])

creating a list takes o(n) space complexity

reading a list at an index that we know array[i], takes constant time o(1)

reading a list takes o(n)

updating a list at an index takes constan time o(1)

updating a list takes linear time o(n)

deleting a list at an index takes constant time o(1)
o(n + n) = o(n)
