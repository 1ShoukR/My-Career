# loops
# Loops are used to go through a specific amount of times 
# and execute code every time it goes through it

#it iterates over list

#it iterates over something

#it can iterate over dictionaries

# it can call something a bunch of times

#it can break your computer immediately forever and you will have to restart

# while loop does something WHILE this is true
# while (condition to evaluate): 
#   while 2>1:
#    print("Yay")

#     # Condition can be checked many times
#    fruits = ["apple", "pineapple", "banana"]
#     # for
#      for singular in list
#      for fruit in fruits:
#          print(fruit)
   
#    # we use lists inside of for loops
# fruits = []
# names = ["students"]


#    for fruit in fruits:
#      print(fruit)
#      for name in names:
#        num+=1
#        print(name)
