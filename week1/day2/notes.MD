syntax - rules of that specific language

# Fundamentals in most programming languages

- in `C` int num equals 10
  num equals 10
- `Python` let num equal 10
  var
- `javascript`
  - const num equals 10
  - let njum equal 10
  - var num equals 10
- loops
- variables
- functions/methods
- classes

# Function

#1. Function always has a name
#2. Has a function argument (somtimes)
#3. has a function body
import numbers
from operator import truediv
from sqlite3 import IntegrityError

print("Hello World")

# Syntax in python for a function is

    #def
    #functionName (cammelCase)
    #has paranthesis ()
    #has colon ():
    #indent after paranthesis
    def sayHi():
      print("Hi")

# run a function, type function name and open and close ()

    - sayHi()

# Variables

    #Variable names
    - teacher = "joe"
    - false = True
    - isHoustonCold = False
    - isItDaytime = True

# Variable types

    - String ""
        - "house"
        - "1"
        - "true"
        - "print()"

# Boolean is true/false

    #is it truthy
    - true
    #is it falsy
    -false

# Intergers

    - anything that is a whole number
        - number = 1
        bignumber = 100000

#Float

- anything with a decimal included in an IntegrityError
- floatNumber = 3.2
- jankyFloat = 3.2e213

# Lists/Arrays

- same thing literally
  students = [
  "jason", "stacy", "West", "Carlos", "Amanda"
  ]
  print(students[1]) - this would print stacy

# Access a list by using what is a called the index of the list/array

- it is the different element of the list IE 1 2 true 3.2, but it starts at 0. IE the number "1" is at 0

# DIctionary/Object

- Variable that has squiglies
- Variable = {"Key": "value",
  "key": "value",
  "age": "old",
  "number": 1,
  "hot" : True,
  }
  #Print the number 1
  print(randomData["number])
  print(randomData["sorry"][3])

print(data["president]["name"])
print(data["president"["location"][0])
