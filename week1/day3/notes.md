# Lists and stuff

array = []
list = []
Access things inside of lists using an index

print(array[0]) (prints whats in the array which right now its nothing)

if you know something in the list, read it as o of 1 (o(1))

if you are inserting something in the list, instert using o(n)

if you wanna read it all, use o(n)



time
space
this is big o notation (shows worst case scenario) and shows the time and space concept

examples

O(1)=constant
    this is things that is simple for the pc to do IE read index o(1)
        pretty much saying worst case scenario this is the result
create a list O(n)
    n stands for how big your list is
        O(n^2) is saying worst case scenario showing worse case scenario is 2x your n value
big companies will test you on big o notation



creating a list takes o(n) space complexity
reading a list at an index that we know arrat[i], takes constant time o(1)
reading a list takes o(n)
updating a list takes constant time o(n)
deleting a at an index takes constant time o(1)
