# Functions and why we use them

- Functions are things we create to do steps that we often repeat
- of ypi fomd ypirse;f wrotomg the same code over and over, its probably prime for a function
- functions basically allow us to do multiple steps over and over but only writing the code once

# dictionaries
Vairable = {
    "num": [1,2,3,4,5],
    "name": "joe",
    "boolean": False,
}


# for num in variable["name"]
print(variable["name])
for num in variable["name"]
    print(name)


# JSON DATA
computer = {
    "monitor": "Benq",
    "ram": "Benq",
    "hddSize": "512gb SSD"
    "fans":[
        {"gpu": "3"},
        {"processor": "1"}
    ]
}

# to change something in a list,
computer["monitor"] = "samsumg"

# can add something to a dictionary with that command too
