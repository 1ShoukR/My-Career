    <ul>
        They are useful for displaying lists of stuff
        That's about it
        I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
    </ul>
    <ul>
        decide if it's an ordered list or not
        if it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
        <li>
            Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
            <ol>
                curveball! You can nest lists inside each other
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
