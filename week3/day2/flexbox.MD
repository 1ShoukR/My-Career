# Flexbox, Only reason CSS DOESNT suck 

flexbox is a modern css tool that was created to handle a lot of the problems that plagued early front end dev specifically with the layout of the website


Flex: defaults to a row layout unless you change it
The best tools are 
- display: flex;
justifiy-content
align-itmes
flex-wrap: Wrap; (this helps keep the elements within the border of the box it is in)
gap: 20px (puts a gap in between every element that is inside the box)
