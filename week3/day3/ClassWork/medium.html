            <h2>Welcome to the Noodle Army!</h2>
            <p>
                The Noodle Army is a community created and ran by Rahmin Shoukoohi and his
                editor Murdoc. The name "Noodle Army" has been coined by his old nick name
                that was given to him by Rahmin's friends back in middle school. He has since
                used the nickname given to him to refer to his following as members of the "Noodle
                Army". I honestly have no idea what else to put in here but all I know is that this
                a blog post I'm supposed to do for my bootcamp class..
