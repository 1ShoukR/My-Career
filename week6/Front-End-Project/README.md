# Week 6 Front End Project


## Overview

This website was built to find and display information based via the competitive Valorant community. It has the ability to show critical statistics that are constantly updated in real-time for the user to enjoy and digest.

### Languages used

I used HTML to create the actual websites and link them together. Each HTML page, bar the homepage, uses a unique JavaScript file linked to them to create functionality within the website. 

### Use of website
There are certain pages which require user input in order to process and display images. After the user inputs their desired data, the API needs a couple seconds in order to obtain that data and create all the necessary element tags and display them, so once you submit, do not be alarmed if the data you requested does not show up instantaneously.
